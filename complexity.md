# 1. The Log Component (log):

- When you see log in complexity, it usually implies that the algorithm is dividing the problem space in half (or some other constant factor) at each step
  - binary search
  - balanced binary tree operations
  - divide-and-conquer algorithms where you split the input
  - operations that repeatedly divide the input size by 2

# Typically implies dividing problem space in half at each step
```py
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2  # Dividing search space in half
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Eliminate left half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Eliminate right half
    return -1
```

# 2. The (m+n) Component:

- This suggests you're dealing with two different input sizes (m and n)
  - Working with two separate arrays/lists
  - Working with a matrix (where m is rows and n is columns)
  - Comparing or merging two different data structures

# Working with two input sizes
```py
def example_two_inputs(array1, array2):  # sizes m and n respectively
    total_size = len(array1) + len(array2)  # m + n
    # Some operation using total_size...
```

# 3. Example of O(log (m+n)) pattern:

- Putting it Together - O(log (m+n)):
- The algorithm will take logarithmic time relative to the sum of both input sizes
- I's more efficient than O(m+n) (linear time)
  - Example operations that might have this complexity:
  - Binary searching in a sorted array formed by combining two arrays of sizes m and n
  - Finding a median in two sorted arrays
  - Some balanced tree operations where the tree size depends on two variables

**To determine if your solution matches O(log (m+n)):**
- Look for operations that divide the problem space in half at each step
- Check if you're reducing the combined size (m+n) by a constant factor in each iteration

**Common patterns include:**
- Binary search-like operations
- Repeatedly dividing the combined input size by 2
- Tree traversals where you eliminate half the remaining nodes at each step
- A quick way to verify if your code matches this complexity:
- If you see a single loop that processes all elements → Not O(log (m+n))
- If you see nested loops → Probably not O(log (m+n))
- If you see the input size being divided by 2 (or another constant) in each iteration → 


```py
def find_kth_element(arr1, arr2, k):
    if not arr1:
        return arr2[k]
    if not arr2:
        return arr1[k]
    
    mid1, mid2 = len(arr1)//2, len(arr2)//2
    
    # Classic log(m+n) pattern: eliminating half of one array each time
    if mid1 + mid2 < k:
        if arr1[mid1] > arr2[mid2]:
            return find_kth_element(arr1, arr2[mid2+1:], k-mid2-1)
        else:
            return find_kth_element(arr1[mid1+1:], arr2, k-mid1-1)
    else:
        if arr1[mid1] > arr2[mid2]:
            return find_kth_element(arr1[:mid1], arr2, k)
        else:
            return find_kth_element(arr1, arr2[:mid2], k)
```

# Comparison of complexities:
```py
def linear_time(arr):     # O(n)
    for x in arr:         # Single loop = linear time
        print(x)

def log_time(arr):        # O(log n)
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:   # Dividing in half each time = log time
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        # Do something
        left = mid + 1
```

# Common patterns that suggest O(log (m+n)):
```py
def typical_log_mn_pattern(arr1, arr2):
    total_len = len(arr1) + len(arr2)
    left, right = 0, total_len
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        # Some comparison or operation
        if some_condition:
            right = mid    # Eliminate upper half
        else:
            left = mid + 1 # Eliminate lower half
```
